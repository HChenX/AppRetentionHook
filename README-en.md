  and other.

# 🌟Module Effect

- After personal testing, the retention time of the background App has increased greatly, and there
  has been no background killing for a long time.
- To my great surprise, even after one night, the app survived in the background and was not killed.
- `These include, but are not limited to: TikTok GitHub(Android) Twitter(X) Telegram YouTobe and other software`

# 💡Module Description

- Module use Hook to change system kill logic. Make app retention time growth.
- But precisely because of this, the module may cause a series of problems:

* Be like:
    * 1.System memory manage failure, can't clean low memory if is.
    * 2.Increase phone idle power consumption. But i think is not important problems. Because is
      very little.
    * 3.The most serious thing is that it may cause the phone to not turn on. So you must be fully
      prepared.

- Reminder: Use for example: `OPPO` `VIVO` `Huawei`and other third-party vendors, they may contain
  vendor-defined kill logic, which has a certain impact on the effect of the module.
- If you can accept these possible issues will give you a very surprising experience with the
  module.
