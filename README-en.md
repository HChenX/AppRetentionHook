    * First: install the Lsp module on your phone.
    * Next: open Lsp app, and activation the module.

- The module achieving app retention by modifying the system kill logic through Hook.
- The module is designed for the Miui of Android 13 `Miui14`. Android 12 and 11 can also be
  used, but the effect is unknown.
- But please note that non Miui system Android 13 is also my recommended option. Can be used
  normally.

# 🌟Module Effect

- After personal testing, app retention time growth. And Hardly encountered app kill situation.
- What surprised me was that after half a day , most apps weren't killed by the system.
- ` Like QQ Bilibili TikTok Coolapk And more test pass , they dont be killed. `
- Although I have only undergone small-scale testing. But the effect is still significant.

# 💡Module Description

- Module use Hook to change system kill logic. Make app retention time growth.
- But precisely because of this, the module may cause a series of problems:

* Be like:
    * 1.System memory manage failure, can't clean low memory if is.
    * 2.Increase phone idle power consumption. But i think is not important problems. Because is
      very little.
    * 3.The most serious thing is that it may cause the phone to not turn on. So you must be fully
      prepared.

- And if you use non Miui Android 13 system and non AOSP system.But use like Flyme,ColorOs...
  manufacturer's custom system, they may contain vendor custom kill logic, Has a certain impact on
  the
  effectiveness of the module.
- If you can accept these possible issues will give you a very surprising experience with the
  module.
